# LyricLearn

## About

 LyricLearn was created for the students who don't get the internet access in my area becasue the internet has been cut off for almost 4 years.
 The students can study and learn English with lyrics by using LyricLearn. And they can save their favourite song's lyric to see it easily next time.
